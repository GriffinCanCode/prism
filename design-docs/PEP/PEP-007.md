**PEP**: 007  
**Title**: BigQuery Compilation Target  
**Author**: Prism Language Team <team@prism-lang.org>  
**Champion**: [To be assigned]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Type**: Feature  
**Created**: 2025-01-17  
**Updated**: 2025-01-17  
**Requires**: PLD-010 (Multi-Target Compilation Possibilities), PEP-005 (PostgreSQL Compilation)  
**Replaces**: None  
**Superseded-By**: None

## Abstract

This PEP proposes adding Google BigQuery as a compilation target for Prism, enabling direct compilation of business logic into BigQuery's serverless data warehouse environment. This approach transforms data analytics from extract-transform-load (ETL) pipelines into compile-time-verified, type-safe data processing workflows. By leveraging BigQuery's massive parallel processing capabilities, automatic scaling, and SQL-based analytics engine, Prism applications can perform enterprise-scale data analysis with the same semantic type safety and business rule enforcement that characterizes other Prism compilation targets.

## Motivation

### The Data Analytics Challenge

Modern enterprises struggle with data analytics pipelines that are fragile, hard to maintain, and prone to runtime failures:

```prism
// Current approach: Fragile ETL pipelines
type CustomerEvent = {
    customer_id: CustomerId,
    event_type: EventType,
    timestamp: DateTime,
    properties: Map<String, Any>, // Untyped properties - source of errors
    revenue: Optional<Money>
}

// Problems with traditional data pipelines:
// 1. Type safety lost when data enters analytics systems
// 2. Business rules duplicated between application and analytics
// 3. Schema evolution breaks downstream consumers
// 4. Complex aggregations require specialized ETL tools
// 5. Data quality issues discovered at runtime, not compile time
```

### BigQuery's Unique Value Proposition

Google BigQuery offers compelling capabilities for data-intensive Prism applications:

- **Serverless Architecture**: No infrastructure management required
- **Massive Scale**: Petabyte-scale data processing
- **SQL-Based**: Familiar query language with advanced analytics functions
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Streaming data ingestion and processing
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Built-in ML capabilities (BigQuery ML)
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay-per-query pricing model
- **Global Availability**: Multi-region data processing

### The Compilation Opportunity

BigQuery compilation enables a revolutionary approach to data analytics:

```prism
// Prism business logic compiled directly to BigQuery
type CustomerSegment = Active | Churned | AtRisk | HighValue

type CustomerAnalytics = {
    customer_id: CustomerId,
    segment: CustomerSegment,
    lifetime_value: Money,
    last_activity: DateTime,
    risk_score: Float with range(0.0, 1.0),
    predicted_churn_date: Optional<DateTime>
} with rules {
    // Business rule: High-value customers cannot be at-risk
    rule high_value_protection: 
        segment == HighValue implies risk_score < 0.3
    
    // Business rule: Churn prediction requires recent activity data
    rule churn_prediction_validity:
        predicted_churn_date.is_some() implies 
        last_activity > (now() - days(90))
}

// Complex analytics compiled to BigQuery SQL
function analyze_customer_segments(
    time_window: TimeWindow
) -> Result<Array<CustomerAnalytics>, AnalyticsError>
    requires BigQueryAccess, MLModelAccess
{
    let customer_events = get_customer_events(time_window)?;
    let purchase_history = get_purchase_history(time_window)?;
    let engagement_metrics = calculate_engagement(customer_events)?;
    
    let analytics = customer_events
        .group_by(|event| event.customer_id)
        .map(|(customer_id, events)| {
            let segment = classify_customer_segment(events, purchase_history)?;
            let ltv = calculate_lifetime_value(customer_id, purchase_history)?;
            let risk_score = predict_churn_risk(customer_id, engagement_metrics)?;
            
            CustomerAnalytics {
                customer_id,
                segment,
                lifetime_value: ltv,
                last_activity: events.map(|e| e.timestamp).max()?,
                risk_score,
                predicted_churn_date: calculate_churn_date(risk_score)?
            }
        })
        .collect()?;
    
    return analytics;
}
```

Compiles to optimized BigQuery SQL:

```sql
-- Generated BigQuery analytics query with business rule enforcement
WITH customer_events AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    event_type,
    timestamp,
    PARSE_JSON(properties) as properties,
    revenue
  FROM `project.dataset.customer_events`
  WHERE timestamp BETWEEN @start_time AND @end_time
),

purchase_history AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(amount) as total_spent,
    COUNT(*) as purchase_count,
    MAX(purchase_date) as last_purchase
  FROM `project.dataset.purchases`
  WHERE purchase_date BETWEEN @start_time AND @end_time
  GROUP BY customer_id
),

engagement_metrics AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    COUNT(*) as event_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(timestamp)) as active_days,
    AVG(CASE WHEN event_type = 'page_view' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as page_view_rate
  FROM customer_events
  GROUP BY customer_id
),

    -- Segment classification logic
    CASE

      ELSE 'Active'
    END as segment,
    
    -- Lifetime value calculation

    -- Risk score using BigQuery ML model
    ML.PREDICT(MODEL `project.dataset.churn_prediction_model`, 
      STRUCT(
        eng.event_count,
        eng.active_days,
        COALESCE(p.purchase_count, 0) as purchase_count,
        DATE_DIFF(@end_time, p.last_purchase, DAY) as days_since_purchase
      )
    ).predicted_churn_probability as risk_score
    
  FROM customer_events e
  LEFT JOIN purchase_history p ON e.customer_id = p.customer_id  
  LEFT JOIN engagement_metrics eng ON e.customer_id = eng.customer_id
  GROUP BY e.customer_id, p.total_spent, p.last_purchase, p.purchase_count, 
           eng.event_count, eng.active_days
)

SELECT 
  customer_id,
  segment,
  lifetime_value,

  risk_score,
  -- Predicted churn date calculation
  CASE 
    WHEN risk_score > 0.7 THEN 
      TIMESTAMP_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL CAST(30 / risk_score AS INT64) DAY)
    ELSE NULL 
  END as predicted_churn_date

FROM customer_segments

-- Business rule enforcement: High-value customers cannot be at-risk
WHERE NOT (segment = 'HighValue' AND risk_score >= 0.3)

-- Business rule enforcement: Churn prediction validity  
AND (predicted_churn_date IS NULL OR 
     last_activity > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 90 DAY))

ORDER BY lifetime_value DESC, risk_score DESC;
```

## Rationale

### Why BigQuery for Data Analytics?

BigQuery provides unique advantages for compiled data analytics:

| Feature | Traditional ETL | BigQuery Compilation |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Type Safety** | Lost at pipeline boundaries | Preserved end-to-end |
| **Business Rules** | Duplicated across systems | Single source of truth |
| **Performance** | Limited by ETL infrastructure | Massive parallel processing |
| **Scalability** | Manual scaling required | Automatic scaling |
| **Cost Model** | Fixed infrastructure costs | Pay-per-query usage |
| **ML Integration** | Separate ML pipelines | Integrated BigQuery ML |

### Compilation Strategy

BigQuery compilation focuses on generating optimized analytical SQL with embedded business logic:

1. **Semantic Types → BigQuery Types**: Map Prism types to BigQuery's rich type system
2. **Business Rules → SQL Constraints**: Embed validation in WHERE clauses and CASE expressions
3. **Complex Analytics → Optimized Queries**: Generate efficient analytical SQL
4. **ML Integration → BigQuery ML**: Compile ML workflows to native BigQuery ML functions

## Specification

### Semantic Type Mapping

BigQuery's rich type system enables sophisticated semantic type preservation:

| Prism Type | BigQuery Type | Benefits |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| `String with validation(pattern)` | `STRING` + `REGEXP_CONTAINS()` | Pattern validation in SQL |
| `Integer with range(min, max)` | `INT64` + range checks | Numeric constraint enforcement |
| `Float with precision(p)` | `NUMERIC(p)` | Exact decimal arithmetic |
| `DateTime` | `TIMESTAMP` | Native timestamp operations |
| `Money` | `NUMERIC(15,2)` | Precise currency calculations |
| `Enum { A, B, C }` | `STRING` + `IN ('A', 'B', 'C')` | Enumeration validation |
| `Array<T>` | `ARRAY<T>` | Native array operations |
| `Optional<T>` | `T` (nullable) | NULL-safe operations |
| `Record { a: A, b: B }` | `STRUCT<a A, b B>` | Nested data structures |
| `Map<K, V>` | `JSON` | Flexible key-value storage |

### Advanced Analytics Compilation

Prism's functional programming constructs map naturally to BigQuery's analytical capabilities:

```prism
// Complex aggregation and windowing functions
function calculate_customer_cohort_analysis(
    cohort_period: Period
) -> Result<Array<CohortAnalysis>, AnalyticsError>
    requires BigQueryAccess
{
    let customers = get_customers()?;
    
    let cohort_analysis = customers
        .group_by(|c| c.registration_date.truncate_to(cohort_period))
        .map(|(cohort_date, cohort_customers)| {
            let retention_rates = calculate_retention_by_period(cohort_customers)?;
            let revenue_per_customer = calculate_revenue_metrics(cohort_customers)?;
            
            CohortAnalysis {
                cohort_date,
                initial_customers: cohort_customers.len(),
                retention_rates,
                revenue_per_customer,
                total_cohort_value: revenue_per_customer.total
            }
        })
        .collect()?;
    
    return cohort_analysis;
}
```

Compiles to sophisticated BigQuery analytics:

```sql
-- Generated cohort analysis with window functions
WITH customer_cohorts AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    registration_date,
    DATE_TRUNC(registration_date, MONTH) as cohort_month
  FROM `project.dataset.customers`
),

customer_activity AS (
  SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.cohort_month,
    p.purchase_date,
    p.amount,
    DATE_DIFF(DATE(p.purchase_date), DATE(c.registration_date), DAY) as days_since_registration
  FROM customer_cohorts c
  LEFT JOIN `project.dataset.purchases` p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
),

cohort_metrics AS (
  SELECT 
    cohort_month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as initial_customers,
    
    -- Retention rates by period
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN days_since_registration BETWEEN 0 AND 30 THEN customer_id END) 
      / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as retention_month_1,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN days_since_registration BETWEEN 31 AND 60 THEN customer_id END) 
      / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as retention_month_2,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN days_since_registration BETWEEN 61 AND 90 THEN customer_id END) 
      / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as retention_month_3,
    
    -- Revenue metrics
    SUM(amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as revenue_per_customer,
    SUM(amount) as total_cohort_value
    
  FROM customer_activity
  GROUP BY cohort_month
)

SELECT 
  cohort_month as cohort_date,
  initial_customers,
  STRUCT(
    retention_month_1,
    retention_month_2, 
    retention_month_3
  ) as retention_rates,
  STRUCT(
    revenue_per_customer,
    total_cohort_value
  ) as revenue_metrics,
  total_cohort_value

FROM cohort_metrics
ORDER BY cohort_month;
```

### Machine Learning Integration

BigQuery ML enables sophisticated predictive analytics compiled directly from Prism:

```prism
// ML model training and prediction compiled to BigQuery ML
function train_churn_prediction_model(
    training_data: Array<CustomerFeatures>
) -> Result<MLModel, MLError>
    requires BigQueryAccess, MLModelAccess
{
    let model = MLModel::new("churn_prediction")
        .algorithm(LogisticRegression)
        .features([
            "days_since_last_purchase",
            "total_purchases",
            "avg_order_value",
            "support_tickets_count"
        ])
        .target("churned")
        .validation_split(0.2)?;
    
    let trained_model = model.train(training_data)?;
    return trained_model;
}

function predict_customer_churn(
    model: MLModel,
    customers: Array<CustomerId>
) -> Result<Array<ChurnPrediction>, MLError>
    requires BigQueryAccess, MLModelAccess
{
    let predictions = model.predict(customers)?;
    return predictions;
}
```

Compiles to BigQuery ML statements:

```sql
-- Model training
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `project.dataset.churn_prediction_model`
OPTIONS(
  model_type='LOGISTIC_REG',
  input_label_cols=['churned'],
  data_split_method='SEQ',
  data_split_col='customer_id'
) AS
SELECT
  days_since_last_purchase,
  total_purchases,
  avg_order_value,
  support_tickets_count,
  churned
FROM `project.dataset.customer_features`
WHERE training_partition = TRUE;

-- Model prediction
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  predicted_churned,
  predicted_churned_probs[OFFSET(1)].prob as churn_probability
FROM ML.PREDICT(
  MODEL `project.dataset.churn_prediction_model`,
  (
    SELECT 
      customer_id,
      days_since_last_purchase,
      total_purchases,
      avg_order_value,
      support_tickets_count
    FROM `project.dataset.customer_features`
    WHERE customer_id IN UNNEST(@customer_ids)
  )
);
```
