## Abstract

The Semantic Type System is the foundational pillar of Prism, designed to carry meaning beyond mere data structure. Unlike traditional type systems that focus on memory layout and basic safety, Prism's semantic types express business rules, domain constraints, and AI-comprehensible intent. This system enables compile-time verification of domain logic, automatic generation of documentation, and seamless AI integration while maintaining zero-cost abstractions and memory safety guarantees.

## Motivation

### The Problem with Traditional Type Systems

Traditional type systems in languages like C++, Java, and even Rust focus primarily on memory safety and basic structural correctness. While these are important, they fail to capture the semantic meaning of data and operations. Consider this common pattern:

```rust
// Traditional approach - types don't express meaning
fn transfer_funds(from: u64, to: u64, amount: u64) -> Result<(), Error> {
    // What if we accidentally swap from and to?
    // What if amount is in the wrong currency?
    // What if account IDs are actually user IDs?
}
```

The function signature tells us nothing about the business logic, constraints, or intended behavior. This leads to:

1. **Runtime errors** that could be caught at compile time
2. **Poor AI comprehension** of code intent
3. **Inadequate documentation** embedded in the code
4. **Difficult maintenance** as domain rules evolve
5. **Security vulnerabilities** from type confusion

### Goals of Semantic Types

1. **Express Domain Logic**: Types should encode business rules and constraints
2. **Enable AI Comprehension**: Types should be syntactically akin to a natural language description
3. **Provide Compile-Time Verification**: Domain violations should be caught at compile time
4. **Support Formal Verification**: Types should enable mathematical proof of correctness
5. **Maintain Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions with compile-time erasure
6. **Ensure Memory Safety**: Build upon proven memory safety foundations

## Design Principles

### P1: Semantic Richness Over Structural Simplicity
Types must express what data means, not just how it's stored. It is the only way to ensure a combined understanding of the codebase by both humans and AI systems.

### P2: AI-First Design
Every type construct should generate structured, machine-readable metadata that external AI systems can understand and work with effectively.

### P3: Compile-Time Verification
Domain logic violations should be impossible to compile.

### P4: Zero-Cost Abstractions
Semantic richness should not impact runtime performance.

### P5: Gradual Adoption
Teams should be able to add semantic information incrementally.

### P6: Formal Verification Ready
Types should support mathematical proof of correctness.

## Technical Specification

### 1. Semantic Type Categories

#### 1.1 Primitive Semantic Types

```prism
// Numeric types with semantic meaning using PLT-000 conversational patterns
what is Money? an amount of currency with business meaning
  needs precision of 2 decimal places
  needs specific currency type
  needs non-negative values

what is AccountId? a unique identifier for financial accounts
  has format "ACC-{8}-{4}-{4}-{4}-{12}"
  needs luhn algorithm checksum validation
  ensures account can be uniquely identified

what is UserId? a unique identifier for system users  
  has format "USR-{8}-{4}-{4}-{4}-{12}"
  needs immutable once created
  ensures user can be uniquely tracked

// Temporal types with business meaning
what is BusinessDay? a date that represents a working day
  excludes saturday and sunday

what is TransactionTimestamp? a precise moment when transaction occurred
  needs microsecond precision
  uses UTC timezone
  needs immutable once set
  needs audit trail capability
  ensures accurate transaction timing
```

#### 1.2 Constrained Types

```prism
// Types with compile-time constraints using conversational patterns
what is EmailAddress? a string that represents a valid email address
  needs pattern matching email format
  needs maximum length of 254 characters
  needs normalized to lowercase
  needs validated before use
  ensures can receive messages

what is PasswordHash? a securely hashed password
  uses argon2id algorithm
  has exactly 60 characters
  needs immutable once created
  needs sensitive data protection (prevents logging)
  needs memory protection
  ensures password security

what is PhoneNumber? a validated phone number
  uses E164 international format
  needs validation before use
  supports regions: US, CA, GB
  ensures can receive calls/messages
```

#### 1.3 Dependent Types

```prism
// Types that depend on runtime values using conversational patterns
what is Vector? a collection with fixed size and type
  has length N determined at compile time
  has optimal alignment for type T
  ensures efficient memory layout

what is Matrix? a two-dimensional array with known dimensions
  has Rows and Cols determined at compile time
  uses row-major memory layout
  ensures efficient matrix operations

// Database-aware dependent types
what is DatabaseRecord? a record that matches a database table
  follows specific table schema
  needs validation before database operations
  has audit fields: created_at, updated_at
  ensures data integrity with database
```

#### 1.4 Effect-Aware Types

```prism
// Types that track computational effects using conversational patterns
what is DatabaseConnection? a connection to database with tracked effects
  has effects: IO operations, transactions, logging
  uses RAII for resource management
  has timeout of 30 seconds
  ensures proper resource cleanup

what is APIResponse? a response from external API call
  has effects: network operations, logging
  uses exponential backoff retry policy
  has timeout of 10 seconds
  ensures reliable API communication
```

### 2. Type Relationships and Hierarchies

#### 2.1 Semantic Inheritance

```prism
// Base semantic type using conversational patterns
what is Entity? a base type for all business objects
  has id: UUID for unique identification
  has created_at: Timestamp when first created
  has updated_at: Timestamp when last modified
  ensures all business objects are trackable

// Derived semantic types
what is User? someone with an account in our system
  extends Entity with common fields
  has email: EmailAddress for communication
  has password_hash: PasswordHash for authentication
  has status: UserStatus for account state
  
  // Semantic constraints using conversational patterns
  rule: email must be unique across all users
  rule: email cannot be changed after verification
  rule: password must be updated every 90 days
  ensures user integrity and security

what is Account? a financial account belonging to a user
  extends Entity with common fields
  has user_id: UserId linking to account owner
  has balance: Money<USD> current account balance
  has account_type: AccountType determining capabilities
  
  // Cross-entity constraints
  rule: balance cannot go negative
  rule: user_id must reference existing User
  rule: account_type determines available operations
  ensures financial integrity and user ownership
```

#### 2.2 Type Composition

```prism
// Composition of semantic types using conversational patterns
what is TransferRequest? a request to transfer money between accounts
  has from_account: AccountId where money comes from
  has to_account: AccountId where money goes to
  has amount: Money<USD> how much to transfer
  has reference: TransactionReference for tracking
  
  // Semantic constraints at composition level
  rule: from_account cannot be same as to_account
  rule: amount must be positive
  rule: reference must be unique
  ensures valid transfer request

what is TransferResult? the outcome of a transfer attempt
  gives Transaction when successful or TransferError when failed
  
  when successful:
    causes AccountBalanceUpdated event
    causes TransactionLogged event
    ensures transaction amount matches request
    ensures transaction accounts match request
    
  when failed:
    causes ErrorLogged event  
    causes AlertTriggered event
    ensures error is either recoverable or permanent
    
  ensures proper transfer outcome handling
```

### 3. AI Metadata Export Features

#### 3.1 AI-Readable Metadata

```prism
what is CreditCard? payment card information stored securely
  has number: String for card identification
  has expiry: Date when card expires
  has cvv: String for security verification
  
  // note: stores credit card information securely
  // compliance: PCI-DSS Level 1, GDPR
  // data classification: restricted
  
  rule: number must be 13-19 digits
  rule: expiry must be future date
  rule: cvv must be 3-4 digits
  rule: all fields required for payment processing
  
  examples of valid cards:
    {number: "4111111111111111", expiry: "2025-12", cvv: "123"}
    {number: "5555555555554444", expiry: "2026-06", cvv: "456"}
    
  examples of invalid cards:
    {number: "1234", expiry: "2020-01", cvv: "12"}
    {number: "", expiry: "2025-13", cvv: "12345"}
    
  ensures secure payment processing
```

#### 3.2 Semantic Annotations

```prism
what does PaymentProcessor do?
  handles payment processing with multiple providers
  processes credit card payments securely
  handles refunds and chargebacks
  manages payment method tokens
  integrates with fraud detection systems
  
  // safety constraints for AI systems:
  rule: never log sensitive payment data
  rule: always use encrypted connections
  rule: validate all input parameters
  rule: implement proper error handling
  
  our capabilities:
    what happens when processing payment?
    given request: PaymentRequest
    {
      validate payment details
      process through payment gateway
      handle response securely
    }
    gives PaymentResult
    
    what happens when refunding payment?
    given transaction_id: TransactionId
    {
      locate original transaction
      process refund through gateway
      update transaction status
    }
    gives RefundResult
    
    what happens when tokenizing card?
    given card: CreditCard
    {
      securely tokenize card details
      store token safely
      return token reference
    }
    gives CardToken
    
  ensures secure payment operations
```

### 4. Memory Safety Integration

#### 4.1 Ownership-Aware Semantic Types

```prism
// Semantic types with ownership semantics
type SecureString = String where {
    ownership: unique,
    memory_protection: true,
    zero_on_drop: true,
    
    // Semantic constraints
    max_length: 1024,
    encoding: "UTF-8",
    validation: required
};

type SharedResource<T> = Arc<Mutex<T>> where {
    ownership: shared,
    thread_safety: required,
    deadlock_prevention: true,
    
    // Semantic constraints
    max_readers: 10,
    timeout: 5.seconds,
    priority_inheritance: true
};
```

#### 4.2 Lifetime-Aware Semantic Types

```prism
// Types with semantic lifetime constraints
type DatabaseTransaction<'conn> = Transaction where {
    connection: &'conn DatabaseConnection,
    isolation_level: ReadCommitted,
    timeout: 30.seconds,
    
    // Semantic lifetime constraints
    lifetime_bound: 'conn,
    auto_rollback: true,
    resource_cleanup: guaranteed
};

type APIRequest<'session> = Request where {
    session: &'session UserSession,
    rate_limit: per_user(100, 1.hour),
    
    // Semantic constraints
    lifetime_bound: 'session,
    authentication: required,
    authorization: role_based
};
```

### 5. Formal Verification Support

#### 5.1 Invariant Specifications

```prism
type BankAccount = {
    id: AccountId,
    balance: Money<USD>,
    owner: UserId,
    status: AccountStatus,
    
    // Formal invariants
    invariant balance_non_negative: balance >= 0.00,
    invariant owner_exists: User.exists(owner),
    invariant status_valid: status in [Active, Suspended, Closed],
    
    // Temporal invariants
    invariant balance_history: |old_balance, new_balance| {
        new_balance >= old_balance - daily_withdrawal_limit
    }
};
```

#### 5.2 Pre/Post Conditions

```prism
what happens when transferring funds?
given from: AccountId and to: AccountId and amount: Money<USD>
expecting both accounts exist and are active
expecting from account has sufficient balance
expecting amount is positive
{
    // First we verify everything is ready
    ensure from account exists and is active
    ensure to account exists and is active  
    ensure from account balance >= amount
    ensure amount > 0.00
    
    // Then we move the money safely
    subtract amount from from account
    add amount to to account
    create transaction record
}
gives Transaction or TransferError

// what could go wrong?
// if from account doesn't exist then return AccountNotFound
// if to account doesn't exist then return AccountNotFound
// if insufficient balance then return InsufficientFunds
// if account is frozen then return AccountFrozen
// and tell them the specific reason for the failure
```

### 6. Compile-Time Verification

#### 6.1 Type-Level Computation

```prism
// Compile-time type validation
type_function validate_currency_pair(from: Currency, to: Currency) -> Bool {
    match (from, to) {
        (USD, EUR) | (EUR, USD) => true,
        (USD, GBP) | (GBP, USD) => true,
        (EUR, GBP) | (GBP, EUR) => true,
        _ => false
    }
}

type CurrencyExchange<From: Currency, To: Currency> = Exchange where {
    from_currency: From,
    to_currency: To,
    
    // Compile-time constraint
    static_assert: validate_currency_pair(From, To),
    
    rate: ExchangeRate<From, To>,
    timestamp: Timestamp
};
```

#### 6.2 Dependent Type Constraints

```prism
// Types that depend on other types
type SortedVector<T: Ord, N: Natural> = Vector<T, N> where {
    sorted: true,
    comparison: T::compare,
    
    // Compile-time verification
    static_assert: N > 0,
    invariant: |v| v.windows(2).all(|w| w[0] <= w[1])
};

type DatabaseQuery<Table: TableSchema, Columns: ColumnList> = Query where {
    table: Table,
    columns: Columns,
    
    // Compile-time schema validation
    static_assert: Columns.all(|col| Table.has_column(col)),
    
    result_type: Record<Columns.types()>,
    validation: schema_compatible
};
```

            "real-time risk monitoring",
            "regulatory compliance required"
        ]
    }
};
```
