# PLT-000: Conversational Grammar for Human-Thinking Code

**Document ID**: PLT-000  
**Status**: Draft  
**Type**: Core Language Specification  
**Author**: Prism Language Team  
**Created**: 2025-01-17  
**Last Modified**: 2025-01-17  

## Abstract

This grammar makes code read like human thinking - natural, contextual, and conversational - while remaining practical, parseable code. No artificial keywords or forced metaphors. Just code that mirrors how developers actually think about problems, explain systems to colleagues, and reason about business logic.

## Core Philosophy: Natural Thinking Patterns

### The Goal
Code should read like explaining your system to a smart colleague. Not formal documentation, not academic papers - just clear, natural explanation of what happens and why.

### Before vs After

**Traditional Grammar:**
```rust
fn process_customer(customer: Customer) -> Result<ProcessingResult, ComplianceError> {
    validate_gdpr_consent(&customer)?;
    // ... implementation
}
```

**Conversational Grammar:**
```prism
// What happens when we process a customer
when processing customer data {
    // First we make sure they actually agreed to this
    ensure customer gave gdpr consent
    
    // Then we can safely work with their information
    // because we have legal permission
    ...
}
```

## Complete Grammar Specification

### 1. Core Structure: Natural Descriptions

```ebnf
# Programs are collections of explanations
program = explanation*

# Each explanation describes what something is or what happens
explanation = 
    | what_is_declaration
    | what_happens_function
    | when_condition_rule
    | how_to_instruction
    | why_justification

# "What is" - defining things naturally
what_is_declaration = 
    "what is" identifier "?" 
    natural_description
    optional_constraints
    
# Examples:
# what is Customer? 
#   someone who trusts us with their personal information
#   needs valid email and gdpr consent
```

### 2. Function Definitions: What Happens

```ebnf
what_happens_function =
    "what happens when" natural_description "?"
    parameter_context?
    expectation_block?
    implementation_block
    result_description

parameter_context = "given" parameter_list
expectation_block = "expecting" constraint_list  
result_description = "gives" return_specification

# Example:
# what happens when processing customer data?
# given customer information and processing context
# expecting valid gdpr consent and verified identity
# {
#     ensure customer gave gdpr consent
#     update customer profile safely
#     log processing event for audit
# }
# gives updated customer or compliance error
```

### 3. Conditional Logic: When/Then Reasoning

```ebnf
when_condition_rule =
    "when" condition_expression
    "then" action_block
    ("because" justification_text)?

condition_expression = natural_language_condition | code_expression
action_block = "{" statement* "}"

# Example:
# when customer account balance goes below zero
# then send overdraft notification
# because legal regulations require disclosure
```

### 4. Type System: Natural Relationships

```ebnf
# Types are described naturally
type_definition =
    "what is" type_name "?"
    type_description
    property_list?
    constraint_list?

property_list = "has" property ("and" property)*
constraint_list = "needs" constraint ("and" constraint)*

# Example:
# what is Customer?
#   a person who uses our service
#   has email, name, and account balance  
#   needs valid email and gdpr consent
```

### 5. Business Rules: Conversational Logic

```ebnf
business_rule =
    "rule:" rule_name
    "when" condition
    "then" action  
    "because" business_justification

# Example:
# rule: overdraft notification
# when account balance < 0
# then notify customer within 24 hours
# because federal banking regulations require it
```

### 6. Error Handling: What Could Go Wrong

```ebnf
error_handling =
    "what could go wrong?"
    error_scenario*
    
error_scenario =
    "if" error_condition
    "then" error_response
    ("and tell them" user_message)?

# Example:
# what could go wrong?
# if customer email is invalid
# then return validation error  
# and tell them "please check your email address"
```

### 7. AI Integration: Natural Metadata

```ebnf
ai_annotation =
    "// " ai_instruction
    | "note:" contextual_information
    | "assumes:" assumption_list
    | "optimizes for:" optimization_goal

# Examples:
# // this function is critical for compliance
# note: customer data is sensitive - handle carefully
# assumes: email validation happened upstream
# optimizes for: data privacy and audit trail
```

### 8. Multi-Syntax Support

The grammar works across all supported syntax styles:

**C-like Style:**
```c
// what happens when processing customer data?
ProcessingResult process_customer(Customer customer) {
    // ensure customer gave gdpr consent
    if (!validate_gdpr_consent(customer)) {
        return compliance_error("missing gdpr consent");
    }
    // ... rest of processing
}
```

**Python-like Style:**
```python
# what happens when processing customer data?
def process_customer(customer: Customer) -> ProcessingResult:
    # ensure customer gave gdpr consent  
    if not validate_gdpr_consent(customer):
        return compliance_error("missing gdpr consent")
    # ... rest of processing
```

**Canonical Prism Style:**
```prism
what happens when processing customer data?
given customer: Customer
expecting valid gdpr consent
{
    ensure customer gave gdpr consent
    update customer profile safely  
    log processing event for audit
}
gives ProcessingResult or ComplianceError
```

### 9. Semantic Parsing Rules

```ebnf
# All syntax styles map to the same semantic structure
semantic_function = {
    intent: natural_description,
    parameters: parameter_context,
    preconditions: expectation_block,
    implementation: statement_block,
    postconditions: result_description,
    ai_metadata: ai_annotation*
}

# The parser extracts meaning regardless of surface syntax
```

### 10. Integration with Existing Systems

#### Lexer Integration
- Natural language comments become first-class semantic elements
- Traditional syntax remains valid but gets enhanced semantic meaning
- AI annotations are parsed as structured metadata

#### Parser Integration  
- Each syntax style has its own parser that produces the same semantic AST
- Natural descriptions become AST node metadata
- Business justifications become constraint annotations

#### Compiler Integration
- Semantic meaning drives optimization decisions
- Natural descriptions inform error messages
- AI metadata guides code generation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Extend Current Grammar
1. Add natural description parsing to existing syntax
2. Implement `when/then/because` constructs
3. Support `what is/what happens` patterns

### Phase 2: Semantic Enhancement
1. Map natural language to semantic metadata
2. Integrate with AI analysis systems
3. Generate human-readable error messages

### Phase 3: Multi-Syntax Unification
1. Ensure all syntax styles produce identical semantics
2. Cross-syntax refactoring and analysis
3. Unified documentation generation

## Examples: Real Code

### Customer Processing System
```prism
what is Customer?
  someone who trusts us with their personal information
  has email, name, account balance, and gdpr consent
  needs verified email and explicit gdpr agreement

what happens when processing customer data?
given customer: Customer and processing context: ProcessingContext
expecting customer gave gdpr consent and email is verified
{
    // First we double-check permissions
    ensure customer gave gdpr consent
    
    // Then we can safely work with their data
    when customer account balance < 0 
    then send overdraft notification
    because federal regulations require disclosure
    
    // Update their profile with new information
    update customer profile safely
    
    // Always log what we did for auditing
    log processing event with timestamp and user id
}
gives updated Customer or ComplianceError

// note: this function handles sensitive PII data
// optimizes for: compliance, audit trail, and user trust
```

### Business Rule Engine
```prism
rule: credit limit adjustment
when customer has good payment history for 6+ months
and current credit utilization < 30%
and no recent credit inquiries
then automatically increase credit limit by 20%
because rewarding good customers improves retention

what could go wrong?
if customer has recent bankruptcy
then deny credit increase
and tell them "credit adjustments unavailable due to recent credit events"

if system cannot verify payment history  
then require manual review
and tell them "your request needs additional verification"
```

## Consolidation of Existing Grammar Fragments

This section shows how all existing grammar fragments from our design documents map to the conversational approach.

### From PLT-001: AST Grammar Integration

**Traditional PLT-001 Grammar:**
```ebnf
function_statement ::=
    function_documentation?
    required_function_annotations
    function_declaration
    function_body?

required_function_annotations ::=
    "@responsibility" string
    (public_function_annotations | private_function_annotations)

function_declaration ::=
    "function" identifier "(" parameter_list ")" 
    ("->" type)?
    effect_clause?
    contract_clause?
```

**Maps to Conversational:**
```prism
// @responsibility becomes natural description
what happens when processing payment?
given payment request: PaymentRequest
expecting valid card and sufficient funds
{
    // function_body becomes natural implementation
    ensure card is valid
    ensure account has sufficient funds
    charge card for amount
}
gives payment confirmation or payment error
```

### From PLD-001: Type System Integration

**Traditional PLD-001 Grammar:**
```ebnf
semantic_type ::=
    primitive_type
    | constrained_type
    | dependent_type
    | composite_type

constrained_type ::=
    base_type "where" constraint_block

constraint ::=
    identifier ":" expression
    | "invariant" identifier ":" expression
    | "requires" ":" expression_list
```

**Maps to Conversational:**
```prism
// constrained_type becomes natural description
what is ValidEmail?
  a string that represents a real email address
  needs @ symbol and valid domain
  ensures can receive messages

// composite_type becomes natural structure
what is Customer?
  someone who uses our service
  has email: ValidEmail
  has name: NonEmptyString  
  has balance: Money
  needs verified identity
```

### From PLD-002: Module System Integration

**Traditional PLD-002 Grammar:**
```ebnf
module_statement ::=
    required_module_annotations
    module_declaration
    "{" section* "}"

section ::=
    "section" section_kind "{" statement* "}"

section_kind ::=
    | "config" | "types" | "errors" | "internal" | "interface"
```

**Maps to Conversational:**
```prism
// module becomes capability description
what does UserManagement do?
  handles everything about users in our system
  manages registration, login, and profiles
  ensures GDPR compliance and security

// sections become natural organization
our configuration:
  minimum password length is 8 characters
  sessions timeout after 30 minutes
  
our types:
  what is User? someone with an account
  what is LoginRequest? credentials for signing in
  
what could go wrong?
  if user not found then return UserNotFound
  if wrong password then return InvalidCredentials
```

### Grammar Mapping Rules

#### 1. Annotations → Natural Descriptions
```ebnf
# Traditional
"@responsibility" string_literal

# Conversational  
"what happens when" natural_description "?"
```

#### 2. Type Constraints → Natural Requirements
```ebnf
# Traditional
base_type "where" constraint_block

# Conversational
type_description "needs" constraint_list
```

#### 3. Function Contracts → Expectations
```ebnf
# Traditional
"requires" expression_list "ensures" expression

# Conversational  
"expecting" constraint_list "{" implementation "}" "gives" result_description
```

#### 4. Error Handling → Problem Scenarios
```ebnf
# Traditional
"error" identifier "(" parameter_list ")"

# Conversational
"what could go wrong?" error_scenario*
```

#### 5. Business Rules → When/Then Logic
```ebnf
# Traditional
"@business_rule" string_literal

# Conversational
"rule:" rule_name "when" condition "then" action "because" justification
```

### Complete Unified Grammar

```ebnf
# Top-level program structure
program = explanation*

explanation = 
    | capability_description    # what does X do?
    | entity_definition        # what is X?
    | process_definition       # what happens when X?
    | rule_definition         # rule: X when Y then Z because W
    | problem_scenario        # what could go wrong?
    | configuration_block     # our configuration:

# Capability descriptions (modules)
capability_description =
    "what does" identifier "do?"
    natural_description
    dependency_list?
    organization_block*

organization_block =
    | configuration_section   # our configuration:
    | type_section           # our types:
    | process_section        # our processes:
    | problem_section        # what could go wrong:

# Entity definitions (types)
entity_definition =
    "what is" identifier "?"
    entity_description
    property_list?
    constraint_list?

property_list = "has" property ("and" property)*
constraint_list = "needs" constraint ("and" constraint)*

# Process definitions (functions)
process_definition =
    "what happens when" natural_description "?"
    parameter_context?
    expectation_block?
    implementation_block
    result_description

parameter_context = "given" parameter_list
expectation_block = "expecting" constraint_list
result_description = "gives" return_specification

# Rule definitions (business logic)
rule_definition =
    "rule:" identifier
    "when" condition_expression
    "then" action_expression
    ("because" justification_text)?

# Problem scenarios (error handling)
problem_scenario =
    "what could go wrong?"
    error_case*

error_case =
    "if" error_condition
    "then" error_response
    ("and tell them" user_message)?

# Implementation blocks
implementation_block = "{" statement* "}"

statement =
    | ensure_statement        # ensure X
    | action_statement        # do X
    | conditional_statement   # when X then Y
    | assignment_statement    # let X be Y

# Natural language elements
natural_description = string_literal | comment_text
justification_text = string_literal
user_message = string_literal

# Multi-syntax support - all map to same semantics
c_like_syntax = traditional_function_syntax
python_like_syntax = indented_function_syntax  
canonical_syntax = conversational_syntax
```

This grammar makes code **genuinely conversational** while remaining **practical, parseable code** that works with all our systems. It's not about adding story keywords - it's about making the natural flow of human thinking into executable syntax.

### Grammar Evolution Path

This grammar represents the evolution from formal specifications to conversational code:

1. **PLT-001** provided the foundational AST structure
2. **PLD-001** added semantic type constraints  
3. **PLD-002** introduced capability-based organization
4. **PLT-000** (this document) unifies all into conversational form

### Implementation Dependencies

The conversational grammar builds on existing infrastructure:

- **Lexer** (prism-lexer): Extended to recognize natural language patterns
- **Parser** (prism-parser): Multi-syntax parsing with semantic mapping
- **AST** (prism-ast): Rich semantic nodes with conversational metadata
- **Semantic Analysis** (prism-semantic): Type checking with natural constraints
- **AI Integration** (prism-ai): Enhanced metadata extraction from natural descriptions

### Backward Compatibility

All existing grammar constructs remain valid:

```prism
// Traditional syntax still works
function processPayment(request: PaymentRequest) -> Result<Payment, PaymentError> {
    // implementation
}

// But conversational syntax is preferred  
what happens when processing payment?
given payment request: PaymentRequest
expecting valid card and sufficient funds
{
    ensure card is valid
    charge card for amount  
}
gives payment confirmation or payment error
```

### Future Extensions

This grammar provides foundation for:

- **Natural Language Programming**: Further conversational constructs
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Enhanced AI understanding from natural descriptions  
- **Business Rule Engines**: Direct business logic expression
- **Documentation Generation**: Automatic docs from conversational code
- **Multi-Language Targets**: Same semantics, different syntax styles

## Validation and Consistency

This section validates the grammar against Prism's core principles:

### ✅ **AI-Native Design**
- Natural descriptions provide rich context for AI systems
- Business justifications enable AI reasoning about code changes
- Conversational patterns match how AI models understand language

### ✅ **Conceptual Cohesion**  
- `what does X do?` capability descriptions group related functionality
- Natural organization mirrors human mental models
- Business rules stay close to the code they govern

### ✅ **Multi-Syntax Support**
- All syntax styles map to identical semantic structures
- Conversational constructs work in C-like, Python-like, and Canonical forms
- Parser generates same AST regardless of surface syntax

### ✅ **Business Logic Integration**
- `rule:` constructs make business rules first-class citizens
- `because` clauses provide business justification
- `what could go wrong?` scenarios handle business exceptions naturally

### ✅ **Safety and Compliance**
- `expecting` blocks make preconditions explicit
- `ensures` statements become natural promises
- Compliance requirements expressed as natural constraints

The grammar successfully unifies all existing specifications while making code genuinely conversational and human-readable.
