# Scripts Directory

This directory contains build and distribution scripts that are part of the Prism project.

## ✅ What SHOULD be committed:
- *.sh scripts (build-images.sh, publish-packages.sh, verify-installation.sh)
- README.md documentation
- This .gitkeep file

## ❌ What should NOT be committed (gitignored):
- generated/ subdirectory (created by scripts)
- Any temporary files created during script execution
- Distribution artifacts (*.tar.gz, *.deb, etc.)
- Docker build cache

The scripts themselves are valuable for users, contributors, and transparency.
Generated artifacts are excluded via .gitignore.
