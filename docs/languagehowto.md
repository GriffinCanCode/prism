# Prism Language Development: Complete Roadmap

## 1. Foundation Layer
**Core Infrastructure**
- Project setup (Rust workspace, build system, CI/CD)
- Lexer (tokenization of source code)
- Parser (AST generation)
- Basic error handling and reporting system

## 2. Language Core
**Semantic Analysis**
- Type system implementation
- Symbol table management
- Scope resolution
- Type checking and inference
- Semantic validation

## 3. Code Generation
**Multi-Target Compilation**
- AST to intermediate representation (IR)
- TypeScript transpiler (rapid prototyping target)
- WebAssembly backend (portable target)
- LLVM backend (native performance target)

## 4. Runtime System
**Execution Environment**
- Memory management model
- Garbage collection (if needed)
- Runtime type information
- Error handling and stack traces
- Standard library runtime support

## 5. Standard Library
**Core Functionality**
- Primitive types and operations
- Collections (arrays, maps, sets)
- String manipulation
- I/O operations
- Mathematical functions
- Date/time handling
- Networking primitives

## 6. Advanced Language Features
**Prism-Specific Features**
- Smart Module system

- Error diagnostics and quick fixes
- Refactoring tools
- Debugger integration

## 8. Package Management
**Ecosystem Infrastructure**
- Package manager design and implementation
- Dependency resolution
- Version management
- Package registry (IPFS-based)
- Build system integration

## 9. Testing Framework
**Quality Assurance**

- Thread safety guarantees
- Synchronization primitives
- Parallel compilation

## 14. Production Readiness
**Enterprise Features**
- Incremental compilation
- Build caching
- Distributed compilation
- Performance profiling
- Security auditing tools

## 15. Community & Ecosystem
**Adoption Support**
- Migration tools from other languages
- Community forums and support
- Plugin architecture
- Third-party tool integration
- Educational resources

**Critical Path Dependencies:**
1. Foundation → Language Core → Code Generation (must be sequential)
2. Runtime System can be developed parallel to Code Generation
3. Standard Library requires Runtime System
4. Developer Tooling requires Language Core
5. Everything else can be built incrementally on top of the core

**Minimum Viable Language:**
Items 1-4 + basic Standard Library = working language that can execute programs

**Production Ready:**
All items completed = enterprise-grade programming language
