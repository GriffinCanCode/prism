# Prism Implementation Plan

This document outlines the technical implementation strategy for Prism, covering the architecture, technology stack, and development roadmap.

## Architecture and Technology Stack

To achieve its goals of performance, safety, and a cutting-edge developer experience, Prism will be built with the following technologies.

### **Compiler Infrastructure**

* **Primary Implementation Language: Rust**
    * **Why**: Rust provides memory safety without a garbage collector, a strong type system, excellent error messages, and first-class support for LLVM and WebAssembly, making it the ideal choice for a modern compiler.
    * **Key Crates**:
        * **Lexing**: `rustc_lexer` for its performance and patterns.
        * **Parsing**: Custom recursive descent parser with Pratt parsing for expressions.
        * **Code Generation**: `cranelift` for WASM and `inkwell` for LLVM bindings.
        * **Incremental Compilation**: `salsa` to ensure fast, responsive compilation cycles.

### **Execution and Compilation Targets**

Prism will follow a hybrid, multi-phase compilation strategy to balance rapid development with high performance.

1. **Initial Target: Transpile to TypeScript**
    * This approach allows for the fastest possible prototyping and iteration by leveraging the mature Deno and Bun runtimes. It provides immediate usability and access to the vast JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem.
2. **Primary Target: WebAssembly (WASM)**
    * Compiling to WASM makes Prism platform-agnostic, secure through sandboxing, and future-proof. It can be run by any compliant WASM runtime, such as **Wasmtime**.
3. **Performance Target: Native Code via LLVM**
    * For performance-critical applications, Prism will compile directly to native code through an LLVM backend, generating highly optimized executables.

## Implementation Roadmap

The development of Prism will proceed in four distinct phases over 12 months.

### **Phase 1: Minimal Viable Compiler (Months 1-3)**

* **Focus**: Establish the core compiler architecture and a working transpiler.
* **Tasks**:
    * Initialize Rust workspace and set up Nix flake for reproducible builds.
    * Develop the Lexer and custom recursive descent Parser with multi-syntax support.
    * Define the AST with structures for rich metadata like documentation and AI hints.
    * Implement the initial semantic type system with support for constraints and units.
    * Build the first code generator: a transpiler to TypeScript to enable rapid testing.

### **Phase 2: Core Language Features & Tooling (Months 4-6)**

* **Focus**: Build out the semantic analysis engine and developer tooling.
* **Tasks**:
    * Develop the **Semantic Analysis Engine**, including the type checker, contract verifier, and the `AIClarityChecker`.
    * Implement the **Language Server (LSP)** in Rust using `tower-lsp` to provide IDE features like AI-aware completions.
    * Create a VSCode extension that integrates the language server.
    * Begin development of the **Conceptual Cohesion Metrics** to provide smart refactoring suggestions.

### **Phase 3: Advanced Compilation & Metadata Export (Months 7-9)**

* **Focus**: Implement high-performance backends and comprehensive metadata export system.
* **Tasks**:
    * Develop the **LLVM backend** for compiling to native code, embedding extensive metadata into the LLVM IR for debugging and analysis.
    * Finalize the **WASM backend**, making it the primary target for portable code.
    * Build the **Metadata Export Layer**, which can analyze Prism code, build a semantic representation, and export structured data for external AI tools to provide feedback on complexity, potential issues, and clarity.

### **Phase 4: Runtime, Standard Library & Ecosystem (Months 10-12)**

* **Focus**: Create the runtime system, a comprehensive standard library, and a decentralized package manager.
* **Tasks**:
    * Build the **Prism Runtime System**, featuring a smart error reporter that explains *what* happened, *why* it happened, and *how to fix it*.
    * Design the **Standard Library** with a "no abbreviations" philosophy, using ultra-descriptive names (e.g., `calculateSquareRootOfNumber` instead of `sqrt`).
    * Develop the **Package Manager**, using IPFS for decentralized, content-addressed storage to ensure reproducibility and security.

## Modern Development Infrastructure

* **Build System**: **Nix and Bazel** will be used to ensure perfectly reproducible and hermetic builds. A `flake.nix` file will define all development environment dependencies.
* **CI/CD Pipeline**: A GitHub Actions workflow will be established to automatically build and test every commit. This pipeline will include a dedicated `ai-clarity-check` job that runs the compiler's analysis tools to prevent unclear code from being merged.
* **Development Environment**: A **VSCode extension** will provide the primary developer interface, offering rich metadata-driven completions and seamless integration with the language server.
